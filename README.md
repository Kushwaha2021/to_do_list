# to_do_list

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

## Description
This is a simple To-Do List application built using Flutter and Firebase. It allows users to register, log in, and manage their to-do items. Each to-do item consists of a title, description, due date, and completion status. The app includes user authentication, CRUD operations, and state management using Provider.

## Features
- User Authentication:
    - Register and log in using email and password with Firebase Authentication.
    - Basic form validation for email format and password strength.
- To-Do List:
    - Create, read, update, and delete to-do items.
    - Each item includes a title, description, due date, and completion status.
    - To-do items are stored in Firebase Firestore and associated with the logged-in user.
- State Management:
    - State management is handled using the Provider package.
- UI/UX:
    - Clean, user-friendly interface.
    - Responsive design for both Android and iOS devices.
    - Basic animations for transitions and status changes.
- Technical Requirements:
    - Built with the latest version of Flutter and Dart.
    - Asynchronous programming and error handling implemented.


## State Management Justification

Provider for state management because it offers a simple yet powerful way to manage state in Flutter applications. Provider is well-integrated with Flutterâ€™s core architecture and allows for easy and efficient state updates. It also promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable.

## Why Provider?
  - Ease of Use: Provider is straightforward to use and integrates well with Flutter's reactive model.
  - Performance: It is efficient and provides good performance for state management.
  - Community Support: It has strong community support and is widely used in the Flutter ecosystem.
  - Flexibility: It allows for both simple and complex state management needs.


## Assumptions

 - Users will only access their own to-do items.
 - Basic email and password validation is sufficient for the scope of this project.
